# Chmura Code assessment

## Live Demo
Live Demo:

## Directions
Use the drop down menus to select any combination of actors. Actors that have costarred in both a movie with Actor A and Actor B (not necessarily at the same time) will be displayed in the right-hand panel.

## Validation
To validate the app is working properly, set Actor A to Nicolas Cage and set Actor B to Keanu Reeves, then click the "submit" button to send that request to the API and validate. (Costar's movies are stored in the request object but not displayed on the page.)

## Thank you!
Thank you for the opportunity to apply, I really had fun working on this assessment and hopefully it demonstrates some of my skillset!
